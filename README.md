## About project

SchoolApp Web Platform for schools and universities. Directors and teachers and other roles for checking and see all things about teachers (employee salaries - history and new salaries, their absents, their work, putting grades to students...) about students (their absents, all students, classes, grades, exams results, their assignments, fees for exams...) and other big things. Of course, these roles can see only their permissions. This project of mine is still being improved now...
